## Basic optics

Lenses as objects that bend light. Define terms.

## Gravitational lensing

Light takes the shortest path. Mass bends spacetime. Light follows that spacetime.

## Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing

The lensing configuration. Some real examples.

## Demo/activity

Wine glasses. Put up images of some strong lenses (quads, doubles, etc.) and try to use wine glass to make same configuration. Ideally, can have differently-shaped source and lensing objects to try to make point about degeneracy.
