## Why go to space?

How small, dim, and rare these objects are. Atmospheric scintillation and IR windows.

## Brief history of space telescopes

Hubble, Nancy Grace Roman, JWST. Space telescope timelines. Video of launch.

## Space telescope technology

L2 and LEO, Deep Space Network, CCDs

## Details of optical/near-IR space telescopes

Give enough background for `mejiro` to make sense and be well-motivated.

* Filters and galaxy SEDs plus redshift
* PSF
* Sky background and Poisson noise
* Other sources of detector noise
